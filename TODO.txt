frenzy gamemode, targets spawn in all different states at same time and are constantly respawning. color changing? "frenzy" gamemode?

visualize target spawn area/target size when changing, line shader when chaning values, example videos? example targets spawning?

Descriptions:
Scatter:
You like ''balls''? Well, there's a LOT of ''balls'' in the Scatter gamemode. The ''balls'' will continuously spawn in a grid box, so you will have plenty of targets to choose from.

Flick:
As simple as can be, youve only got to focus on one target at a time. Practice those quick, but controlled, flicks from every possible direction.

Grid:
Old faithful. An FPS players' best friend. The perfect combination of speed and accuracy practice in this triple target, grid wall layout. EZ.

Grid 2:
Grid the 2nd, a bit more challenging. Same concept as 'Grid', but with more inital targets and a MUCH smaller target size. Take you time on this one.

Pairs:
The game is simple. Match the spawned target to its appropriately matched color buddy. The targets switch colors at random, so stay focused.

Follow:
Classic tracking target gamemode. Try to keep your crosshair on the target as it floats around your non existant body. It's pretty easy, just do it man. Christ.

"achievments" or "medals" for special happenings in the game, like an all green/gold/red color outcome in the afterActionReport. all red: "yuck" all gold: "i love goooold". somehow an all grey outcome could have something.


ui drag system for someaimgame. certain elements of the ui will be dragable, like the settings/afteractionreport/extrastats panel etc, and when the elements are being dragged, available locations will be highlighted in different spots, when dragging is done, if cursor holding ui element is inside available move spot, that ui will be placed in the new spot, and location saved.



NEW STUFF (1/5/2021):

** - Click to expand on AAR stat rows. Possibly opens up graph or more extended stats. Saves opened/closed?

** - Write new robust system for new gamemodes? Like config files for gamemodes and what happens on target clicks and stuff. Or at least system for adding new gamemode button, rather than manually going through the files and adding to enums and etc.
